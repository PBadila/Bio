   <h1>Pita</h1> 
   <p>My name is Pita. I am currently in-between last names and enjoying just being Pita.  I am a mom to 5 amazing people, whom I have homeschooled for the past 24 years.  
    I am a Chemist, an Herbalist, an Urban Agriculturist, a Kemetic Yoga Instructor, a Sound Healer, and a Reiki Master.
    I also love coding.  I ran a homeschool technology program for 10 years, instructing youth in website design, game making, and robotics.

   <p>Purple is the color of my happiness. Prince is my Muse. I enjoy music, reading, cooking, making soap and other cool stuff, gardening, being out in nature, meditating, 
    and doing magical Unicorn Pisces type stuff. Oh, and one day, I'll play the guitar.</p>
